# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves removing WebSocket functionality that couldn't be made to work reliably and cleaning up the unused Settings tab in the admin dashboard. The system has already moved to polling-based chat, making WebSocket components obsolete. Additionally, there's a Settings tab in the navigation that doesn't have any actual content or functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Remove WebSocket Components and Services

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove all WebSocket-related components and services so that the codebase is clean and only contains working functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the frontend codebase THEN all WebSocket service files SHALL be removed
2. WHEN reviewing React components THEN all WebSocket test components SHALL be removed  
3. WHEN reviewing the admin dashboard THEN the WebSocket Test navigation item SHALL be removed
4. WHEN reviewing component imports THEN all WebSocket service imports SHALL be removed
5. WHEN building the application THEN there SHALL be no compilation errors related to missing WebSocket dependencies
6. WHEN running the application THEN there SHALL be no console errors related to WebSocket functionality

### Requirement 2: Remove Unused Settings Tab

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the navigation to only show functional tabs so that I don't encounter empty or non-functional pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the admin sidebar navigation THEN there SHALL be no standalone "Settings" tab
2. WHEN navigating through admin routes THEN there SHALL be no route for a general settings page
3. WHEN reviewing the codebase THEN any references to a general settings route SHALL be removed
4. WHEN using the admin dashboard THEN all remaining navigation items SHALL be functional

### Requirement 3: Clean Up WebSocket References in Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove WebSocket configuration options so that the configuration is simplified and only contains relevant settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing chat configuration components THEN WebSocket-specific settings SHALL be removed
2. WHEN reviewing environment configuration THEN WebSocket URL configurations SHALL be removed or marked as deprecated
3. WHEN reviewing chat mode toggles THEN WebSocket mode options SHALL be removed
4. WHEN reviewing performance stats THEN WebSocket metrics SHALL be removed

### Requirement 4: Update Documentation and Comments

**User Story:** As a developer, I want documentation to reflect the current polling-based architecture so that future developers understand the system correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing code comments THEN references to WebSocket functionality SHALL be updated or removed
2. WHEN reviewing component documentation THEN WebSocket-related documentation SHALL be removed
3. WHEN reviewing service documentation THEN only polling-based chat documentation SHALL remain
4. WHEN reviewing README files THEN WebSocket setup instructions SHALL be removed

### Requirement 5: Maintain Existing Polling Functionality

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the existing polling-based chat to continue working normally after WebSocket removal so that chat functionality is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the admin chat THEN polling-based chat SHALL continue to work normally
2. WHEN using simple chat components THEN they SHALL continue to function without WebSocket dependencies
3. WHEN reviewing chat services THEN polling chat service SHALL remain intact and functional
4. WHEN testing chat functionality THEN all existing chat features SHALL work as before

### Requirement 6: Clean Up Test Files

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test files to be updated to remove WebSocket-related tests so that the test suite runs cleanly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN there SHALL be no failing tests due to missing WebSocket components
2. WHEN reviewing test files THEN WebSocket-specific test cases SHALL be removed
3. WHEN reviewing mock implementations THEN WebSocket mocks SHALL be removed
4. WHEN running the full test suite THEN all tests SHALL pass without WebSocket dependencies
