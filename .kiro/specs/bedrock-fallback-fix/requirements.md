# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current AI chat system is returning empty responses to users, which breaks the core functionality of the AI assistant. The root issue is that the primary Bedrock AI service integration is disabled (commented out in the code) and there's no working backup system. This means users send messages but receive completely empty responses, making the AI assistant unusable.

This feature will:
1. **Fix the primary Bedrock AI integration** - Restore the main AI service to provide high-quality, intelligent responses
2. **Implement a robust fallback system** - Provide intelligent responses when Bedrock is temporarily unavailable
3. **Ensure reliable error handling** - Guarantee users always receive meaningful responses

The goal is to have a fully functional AI assistant that provides expert-level AWS consulting responses through Bedrock, with intelligent fallbacks to ensure 100% response reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a cloud consultant using the AI assistant, I want the primary Bedrock AI service to work properly so that I get high-quality, intelligent responses to my AWS consulting questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send a message to the AI assistant THEN the system SHALL first attempt to use the Bedrock service for intelligent responses
2. WHEN the Bedrock service is available THEN I SHALL receive expert-level AWS consulting responses within 5 seconds
3. WHEN I ask technical questions THEN Bedrock SHALL provide detailed, specific, and actionable AWS guidance
4. WHEN Bedrock generates responses THEN they SHALL be professional, accurate, and suitable for client presentations
5. WHEN the Bedrock service is working THEN responses SHALL include specific AWS service recommendations and implementation guidance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a cloud consultant, I want the Bedrock service to be properly configured and integrated so that it can generate expert-level AWS consulting responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL properly initialize the Bedrock service with correct AWS credentials and configuration
2. WHEN I send a message THEN the system SHALL construct appropriate prompts for AWS consulting scenarios
3. WHEN calling Bedrock THEN the system SHALL use optimal parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.) for consulting responses
4. WHEN Bedrock returns a response THEN the system SHALL properly parse and format the content for display
5. WHEN Bedrock API calls are made THEN they SHALL include proper error handling and retry logic

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper AWS Bedrock service configuration so that the AI assistant can connect to and use AWS Bedrock successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load AWS credentials from environment variables or AWS credential chain
2. WHEN connecting to Bedrock THEN it SHALL use the correct AWS region and service endpoint
3. WHEN making Bedrock API calls THEN it SHALL use the appropriate model (e.g., Claude, Nova) for consulting responses
4. WHEN Bedrock service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL detect this and log appropriate error messages
5. WHEN AWS credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for troubleshooting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a cloud consultant, I want intelligent fallback responses when Bedrock is temporarily unavailable so that I always get useful responses during client meetings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Bedrock service fails or returns empty responses THEN the system SHALL automatically use intelligent fallback responses
2. WHEN using fallback responses THEN they SHALL be contextual and relevant to the user's question type
3. WHEN I ask security questions during fallback THEN I SHALL receive AWS security best practices and compliance guidance
4. WHEN I ask cost questions during fallback THEN I SHALL receive cost optimization strategies and tools
5. WHEN fallback is used THEN the response quality SHALL be professional and suitable for client presentations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging so that I can troubleshoot Bedrock integration issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Bedrock API calls are made THEN all requests and responses SHALL be logged with appropriate detail levels
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be categorized (authentication, rate limiting, service unavailable, etc.)
3. WHEN Bedrock returns empty or invalid responses THEN this SHALL be detected and logged as an error
4. WHEN fallback responses are used THEN this SHALL be logged for monitoring and alerting
5. WHEN the system recovers from errors THEN it SHALL automatically retry Bedrock integration without manual intervention
