# Implementation Plan

This implementation plan fixes the critical issue where AI chat responses are empty by properly integrating the existing AWS Bedrock service with the simple chat handler. The Bedrock service and fallback responses are already implemented - we just need to connect them properly and ensure the configuration is correct.

- [ ] 3. Fix Bedrock service configuration and initialization
  - Verify BedrockService is properly injected into SimpleChatHandler constructor
  - Check that Bedrock configuration (API keys, endpoints) is properly loaded

  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

## Phase 2: Verify and Enhance Existing Fallback System

- [ ] 4. Test and validate existing fallback responses

  - Verify the existing generateFallbackResponse method is working correctly

  - Add logging to track when fallback responses are used vs Bedrock responses
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 5. Enhance fallback response quality and coverage

  - Review and improve existing fallback response templates for completeness
  - Add more specific AWS service recommendations to fallback responses
  - Include relevant documentation links in fallback responses where appropriate
  - Add fallback responses for additional consulting scenarios not currently covered
  - _Requirements: 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 6. Implement fallback response analytics and monitoring
  - Add metrics tracking for Bedrock vs fallback response usage
  - Implement logging to identify when and why fallback responses are triggered
  - Create monitoring to track fallback response effectiveness
  - Add alerts when fallback usage exceeds normal thresholds
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.5_

## Phase 3: AWS Bedrock Service Configuration and Testing

- [ ] 7. Configure AWS Bedrock service environment

  - Set up proper AWS credentials for Bedrock access (environment variables or IAM roles)
  - Configure Bedrock service endpoints and model selection (Nova Lite model)
  - Verify AWS IAM permissions for Bedrock service access
  - Test the existing bedrock.go service with real AWS Bedrock API calls
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 8. Implement enhanced response processing and validation

  - Add response validation to ensure Bedrock returns non-empty content
  - Implement response metadata tracking (tokens used, response time, model used)
  - Add response quality checks and filtering for professional content
  - Create consistent response formatting for both Bedrock and fallback responses
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.4, 4.5, 5.4_

- [ ] 9. Add comprehensive logging and error tracking
  - Implement structured logging for all Bedrock API calls with correlation IDs
  - Add detailed error logging for Bedrock service failures
  - Create metrics collection for Bedrock success rates and response times
  - Add monitoring for when fallback responses are used instead of Bedrock
  - Implement alerting for high Bedrock failure rates or cost thresholds
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

## Phase 4: Configuration and Environment Setup

- [ ] 10. Create Bedrock configuration management

  - Add environment variable configuration for AWS credentials
  - Implement Bedrock model selection and parameter configuration
  - Create region and endpoint configuration management
  - Add timeout and retry configuration options
  - Implement configuration validation and error reporting
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.5_

- [ ] 11. Add AWS credential and permission setup

  - Document required AWS IAM permissions for Bedrock access
  - Create environment variable setup guide for AWS credentials
  - Add AWS credential validation and error reporting
  - Implement credential rotation and refresh handling
  - Create troubleshooting guide for common AWS setup issues
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.5_

- [ ] 12. Implement service health monitoring
  - Create Bedrock service health check endpoint
  - Add AWS credential validation checks
  - Implement service availability monitoring
  - Create health status reporting for admin dashboard
  - Add automated recovery mechanisms for service failures
  - _Requirements: 3.4, 5.1, 5.5_

## Phase 5: Testing and Quality Assurance

- [ ] 13. Create comprehensive unit tests

  - Write unit tests for Bedrock service client functionality
