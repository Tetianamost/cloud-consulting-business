# Build Error Fixes - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the compilation and build errors present in both the backend Go application and frontend React application. The primary issue is multiple standalone test files using `package main` which causes redeclaration errors during the build process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Backend Build Error Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend Go application to build successfully without compilation errors, so that I can deploy and run the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `go build ./...` in the backend directory THEN the build SHALL complete successfully without errors
2. WHEN running `go build ./cmd/server` THEN the main application SHALL compile successfully
3. WHEN multiple test files exist with `package main` THEN they SHALL NOT conflict with each other during build
4. IF test files are standalone executables THEN they SHALL be organized to avoid build conflicts
5. WHEN running `go mod tidy` and `go mod verify` THEN all dependencies SHALL be properly resolved

### Requirement 2: Frontend Build Error Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend React application to build successfully without TypeScript or compilation errors, so that I can deploy the web application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run build` in the frontend directory THEN the build SHALL complete successfully
2. WHEN running TypeScript compilation checks THEN there SHALL be no type errors
3. WHEN running tests THEN all test files SHALL execute without compilation errors
4. IF there are missing dependencies THEN they SHALL be properly installed and configured
5. WHEN linting is available THEN code SHALL pass linting checks

### Requirement 3: Test File Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test files to be properly organized so that they don't interfere with the main application build process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN standalone test files exist THEN they SHALL be moved to a dedicated testing directory
2. WHEN test files use `package main` THEN they SHALL be isolated from the main build process
3. WHEN running integration tests THEN they SHALL be executable independently
4. IF test files share common functionality THEN duplicate code SHALL be eliminated
5. WHEN building the application THEN test files SHALL NOT cause redeclaration errors

### Requirement 4: Build Process Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an optimized build process that clearly separates application code from test utilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for production THEN only necessary application files SHALL be included
2. WHEN running development builds THEN the process SHALL be fast and reliable
3. WHEN test utilities are needed THEN they SHALL be easily accessible but separate from main code
4. IF build scripts exist THEN they SHALL work correctly with the new file organization
5. WHEN CI/CD processes run THEN builds SHALL be consistent and reproducible

### Requirement 5: Documentation and Maintenance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation on the build process and file organization so that future development is streamlined.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new developers join THEN they SHALL understand the build process from documentation
2. WHEN test files are added THEN guidelines SHALL exist for proper organization
3. WHEN build issues occur THEN troubleshooting steps SHALL be documented
4. IF file organization changes THEN documentation SHALL be updated accordingly
5. WHEN maintaining the codebase THEN the separation of concerns SHALL be clear and logical
