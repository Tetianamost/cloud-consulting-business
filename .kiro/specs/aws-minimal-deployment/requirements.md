# AWS Minimal Deployment Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines requirements for deploying the Cloud Consulting Platform on AWS using the most cost-effective approach while leveraging existing $400 AWS credits. The focus is on minimal setup time, maximum credit utilization, and simple architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Maximize AWS Credit Usage

**User Story:** As a startup founder with $400 AWS credits, I want to deploy my application cost-effectively so that I can run for months without paying out of pocket.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying infrastructure THEN the system SHALL use AWS free tier services where possible
2. WHEN selecting instance types THEN the system SHALL prioritize t3.micro and t3.small (free tier eligible)
3. WHEN configuring services THEN the system SHALL avoid expensive managed services initially
4. WHEN monitoring costs THEN the system SHALL track credit usage and provide alerts
5. WHEN scaling THEN the system SHALL provide upgrade path to paid services when credits are exhausted

### Requirement 2: Simple Single-Instance Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple deployment architecture so that I can get to production quickly with minimal complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL use a single EC2 instance for the application
2. WHEN setting up database THEN the system SHALL use RDS db.t3.micro (free tier)
3. WHEN configuring storage THEN the system SHALL use EBS volumes within free tier limits
4. WHEN setting up networking THEN the system SHALL use default VPC to minimize complexity
5. WHEN managing services THEN the system SHALL minimize the number of AWS services used

### Requirement 3: Leverage Existing AWS Services

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want to use my existing AWS SES and Bedrock configurations so that I don't need to reconfigure external services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring email THEN the system SHALL use existing AWS SES setup
2. WHEN configuring AI THEN the system SHALL use existing AWS Bedrock configuration
3. WHEN setting up authentication THEN the system SHALL use existing AWS credentials
4. WHEN deploying THEN existing environment variables SHALL work without modification
5. WHEN integrating THEN all current AWS service functionality SHALL be preserved

### Requirement 4: Automated Deployment with Minimal Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated deployment with minimal manual configuration so that I can deploy quickly without infrastructure expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL use AWS App Runner or Elastic Beanstalk for simplicity
2. WHEN configuring THEN the system SHALL auto-detect application requirements
3. WHEN building THEN the system SHALL handle Docker containerization automatically
4. WHEN updating THEN the system SHALL support git-based deployments
5. WHEN scaling THEN the system SHALL provide automatic scaling capabilities

### Requirement 5: Cost Monitoring and Optimization

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to monitor AWS credit usage so that I can optimize costs and plan for when credits are exhausted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring THEN the system SHALL track daily AWS credit consumption
2. WHEN alerting THEN the system SHALL notify when credits reach 75% and 90% usage
3. WHEN optimizing THEN the system SHALL identify cost optimization opportunities
4. WHEN forecasting THEN the system SHALL predict credit exhaustion timeline
5. WHEN transitioning THEN the system SHALL provide guidance for moving to paid services

### Requirement 6: Database and Storage Management

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want managed database services so that I don't need to handle database administration tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up database THEN the system SHALL use RDS PostgreSQL db.t3.micro
2. WHEN configuring storage THEN the system SHALL use 20GB storage (free tier limit)
3. WHEN backing up THEN the system SHALL enable automated backups within free tier
4. WHEN securing THEN the system SHALL configure database security groups properly
5. WHEN migrating THEN the system SHALL run database migrations automatically

### Requirement 7: SSL and Domain Configuration

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want SSL certificates and custom domain support so that my application appears professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring SSL THEN the system SHALL use AWS Certificate Manager (free)
2. WHEN setting up domains THEN the system SHALL support custom domain configuration
3. WHEN routing traffic THEN the system SHALL use Application Load Balancer if needed
4. WHEN redirecting THEN the system SHALL redirect HTTP to HTTPS automatically
5. WHEN renewing THEN SSL certificates SHALL renew automatically

### Requirement 8: Monitoring and Logging

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want basic monitoring and logging so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor application health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring THEN the system SHALL use CloudWatch free tier for basic metrics
2. WHEN logging THEN the system SHALL aggregate application logs in CloudWatch
3. WHEN alerting THEN the system SHALL set up basic health check alerts
4. WHEN debugging THEN logs SHALL be easily accessible and searchable
5. WHEN analyzing THEN the system SHALL provide basic performance metrics

### Requirement 9: Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want proper security controls so that my application and data are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring access THEN the system SHALL use IAM roles with least privilege
2. WHEN securing network THEN the system SHALL configure security groups appropriately
3. WHEN managing secrets THEN the system SHALL use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
4. WHEN encrypting THEN the system SHALL encrypt data at rest and in transit
5. WHEN auditing THEN the system SHALL enable CloudTrail for security monitoring

### Requirement 10: Backup and Recovery

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want automated backups so that I can recover from failures without data loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backing up database THEN RDS SHALL perform automated backups daily
2. WHEN backing up application THEN the system SHALL backup application code and configuration
3. WHEN storing backups THEN the system SHALL use S3 for cost-effective storage
4. WHEN recovering THEN the system SHALL provide documented recovery procedures
5. WHEN retaining THEN backups SHALL be retained for appropriate periods within cost limits
