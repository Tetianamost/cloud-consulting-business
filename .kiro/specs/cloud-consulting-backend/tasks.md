# Implementation Plan - Minimal Working Backend

This implementation plan focuses on creating a minimal, working Go backend that can accept and store inquiries. Advanced features like validation, testing, hooks, and external integrations will be added in future iterations.

- [x] 1. Set up basic project structure
  - Create Go module with minimal directory structure (cmd, internal)
  - Set up basic configuration management with environment variables
  - Create simple .env file for local development
  - _Requirements: 5.3, 7.3_

- [x] 2. Create minimal HTTP server
  - Set up Gin web framework with basic middleware (CORS, logging, recovery)
  - Implement basic server startup and graceful shutdown
  - Add simple configuration loading without validation
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 3. Add health check endpoint
  - Implement GET /health endpoint that returns server status
  - Include basic server information (service name, version, timestamp)
  - Test endpoint responds correctly
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 6.1_

- [x] 4. Create basic data models
  - Define simple Inquiry struct with essential fields (name, email, company, phone, services, message)
  - Create CreateInquiryRequest struct for API input
  - Add basic service type constants (assessment, migration, optimization, architecture_review)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4_

- [x] 5. Implement in-memory storage
  - Create simple in-memory storage for inquiries using Go maps
  - Implement basic CRUD operations (Create, Read by ID, List all)
  - Add thread-safe access with mutex
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.2_

- [x] 6. Build inquiry endpoints
  - Implement POST /api/v1/inquiries endpoint with basic validation
  - Add GET /api/v1/inquiries/{id} endpoint to retrieve single inquiry
  - Create GET /api/v1/inquiries endpoint to list all inquiries
  - Include basic error handling and JSON responses
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 5.3_

- [x] 7. Add service configuration endpoint
  - Implement GET /api/v1/config/services endpoint
  - Return available service types with descriptions
  - Format response for frontend consumption
  - _Requirements: 1.2_

- [x] 8. Create basic documentation
  - Add README.md with setup and usage instructions
  - Document available API endpoints with examples
  - Include curl commands for testing endpoints
  - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2_

- [x] 9. Test the complete flow
  - Start the server locally
  - Test health check endpoint
  - Create sample inquiry via POST endpoint
  - Retrieve inquiry via GET endpoint
  - Verify all endpoints work correctly
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2_

## Future Iterations (Not in this implementation)

The following features will be added in subsequent iterations:
- Database integration (PostgreSQL)
- Advanced validation and error handling
- AI report generation with LLM integration
- Email and Slack notifications
- Agent hooks system
- Comprehensive testing suite
- External service integrations (AWS S3, SQS)
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and security features
- Monitoring and metrics
- Docker containerization
- Production deployment setup
