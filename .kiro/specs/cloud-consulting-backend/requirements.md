# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive Go backend system for processing and categorizing cloud consulting service inquiries. The system will handle four main service types (Assessment, Migration, Optimization, Architecture Review), automatically generate draft reports using AI agents, notify consultants, and maintain detailed logging. The backend will integrate seamlessly with the existing Netlify-hosted React frontend and support secure AWS deployment with extensibility for future services and cloud providers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a potential client, I want to submit service inquiries through the frontend so that I can request cloud consulting services and receive appropriate responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client submits an inquiry THEN the system SHALL accept and validate the inquiry data
2. WHEN an inquiry is received THEN the system SHALL categorize it into one of four service types: Assessment, Migration, Optimization, or Architecture Review
3. WHEN inquiry data is invalid THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages with validation details
4. WHEN an inquiry is successfully processed THEN the system SHALL return a confirmation with a unique inquiry ID

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a consultant, I want the system to automatically generate draft reports for new inquiries so that I can quickly review and respond to client requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new inquiry is processed THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger an agent hook to generate a draft report
2. WHEN generating a draft report THEN the system SHALL use plain text format compatible with LLM processing
3. WHEN a draft report is generated THEN the system SHALL store it with the inquiry record
4. IF report generation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing the inquiry

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a consultant, I want to be notified when new inquiries arrive so that I can respond promptly to potential clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new inquiry is processed THEN the system SHALL send a notification to the assigned consultant
2. WHEN sending notifications THEN the system SHALL include inquiry details and generated report summary
3. WHEN notification delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times and log failures
4. WHEN multiple consultants are available THEN the system SHALL distribute inquiries based on service type expertise

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging of all inquiry processing activities so that I can monitor system performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any inquiry processing occurs THEN the system SHALL log all significant events with timestamps
2. WHEN logging events THEN the system SHALL include inquiry ID, service type, processing stage, and outcome
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL log generation time, success/failure status, and report metadata

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend to integrate seamlessly with the existing React frontend so that the user experience remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend makes API requests THEN the system SHALL respond with consistent JSON format
2. WHEN handling CORS requests THEN the system SHALL allow requests from the Netlify-hosted frontend domain
3. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL follow RESTful conventions and HTTP status codes
4. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL integrate with the frontend's authentication mechanism

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the backend to support secure AWS deployment so that the system can be hosted reliably in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to AWS THEN the system SHALL support containerized deployment using Docker
2. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL encrypt data in transit and at rest
3. WHEN accessing AWS services THEN the system SHALL use IAM roles and policies for secure authentication
4. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling through load balancers

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want the system architecture to be extensible so that we can easily add new services and cloud providers in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new service types THEN the system SHALL support configuration-driven service definitions
2. WHEN integrating new cloud providers THEN the system SHALL use plugin-based architecture for provider-specific logic
3. WHEN extending functionality THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing APIs
4. WHEN modifying the system THEN the system SHALL support feature flags for gradual rollouts

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want all documentation and specifications to be maintained in plain text format so that they integrate well with AI tools and Jira workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating documentation THEN the system SHALL generate and maintain plain text documents
2. WHEN storing specifications THEN the system SHALL organize them in the /docs directory with clear structure
3. WHEN generating diagrams THEN the system SHALL use Mermaid format for compatibility with documentation tools
4. WHEN updating documentation THEN the system SHALL maintain version history and linking between related documents
