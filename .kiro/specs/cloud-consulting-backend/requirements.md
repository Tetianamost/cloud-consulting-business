# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive Go backend system for processing and categorizing cloud consulting service inquiries. The system will handle four main service types (Assessment, Migration, Optimization, Architecture Review), automatically generate draft reports using AI agents, notify consultants, and maintain detailed logging. The backend will integrate seamlessly with the existing Netlify-hosted React frontend and support secure AWS deployment with extensibility for future services and cloud providers.
