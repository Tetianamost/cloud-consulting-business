## Implementation Notes

### Priority Order
1. **Phase 1 (Diagnostic)** - Must understand root causes before implementing fixes
2. **Phase 2 (Simple Chat)** - Core functionality that must work reliably
3. **Phase 3 (UI Cleanup)** - Important for user experience but not blocking
4. **Phases 4-6** - Validation, documentation, and optimization

### Risk Mitigation
- Implement simple chat alongside existing system initially
- Test thoroughly before removing legacy components
- Maintain rollback capability throughout deployment
- Document all changes for future maintenance

### Quality Gates
- Each phase must be validated before proceeding to next phase
- End-to-end testing required before considering any task complete
- Code review required for all implementation changes
- User acceptance testing for UI changes

This implementation plan prioritizes working functionality over complex features, ensuring reliable chat communication and clean user interface.
