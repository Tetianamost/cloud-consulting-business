# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The chat widget is experiencing WebSocket connectivity issues where users see a "connecting" state that never resolves, with error code 1006 (abnormal closure) appearing in browser logs. This prevents the live chat functionality from working properly, blocking user interactions with the AI consultant.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user opening the chat widget, I want the WebSocket connection to establish successfully so that I can interact with the AI consultant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the chat widget THEN the WebSocket connection SHALL establish within 5 seconds
2. WHEN the WebSocket connection is established THEN the chat interface SHALL show "Connected" status
3. IF the WebSocket connection fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message with troubleshooting guidance
4. WHEN the connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic reconnection with exponential backoff

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive WebSocket connection diagnostics so that I can quickly identify and resolve connectivity issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebSocket connection fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including URL, status codes, and network conditions
2. WHEN debugging WebSocket issues THEN the system SHALL provide connection health checks and validation tools
3. IF the backend WebSocket server is unavailable THEN the system SHALL detect this condition and provide appropriate feedback
4. WHEN connection issues occur THEN the system SHALL validate both frontend configuration and backend server status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the WebSocket server to be properly configured and running so that chat functionality works reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend server starts THEN the WebSocket endpoint SHALL be available and accepting connections
2. WHEN checking server health THEN the WebSocket service SHALL respond to health checks
3. IF there are configuration issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the problem
4. WHEN the server is running THEN it SHALL handle WebSocket upgrade requests correctly with proper CORS headers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want graceful error handling when WebSocket connections fail so that I understand what's happening and what I can do about it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebSocket connection fails THEN the UI SHALL display user-friendly error messages instead of technical error codes
2. WHEN connection is lost THEN the system SHALL show reconnection attempts with progress indicators
3. IF connection cannot be established THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative contact methods or troubleshooting steps
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL not spam the console with repeated error messages
