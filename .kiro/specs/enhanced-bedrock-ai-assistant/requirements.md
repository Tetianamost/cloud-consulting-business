# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing Bedrock AI integration to transform it from a basic report generator into a comprehensive, intelligent cloud consulting assistant. The enhanced system will provide specific cloud provider documentation references, help consultants prepare for customer interviews, generate direct and actionable reports with minimal fluff, and support multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) rather than just AWS. The AI assistant will serve as a knowledgeable partner that helps consultants deliver more value to their clients through precise, well-researched recommendations.

**IMPORTANT: These AI-generated reports are internal tools for cloud consulting business employees/consultants. They are NOT sent directly to customers. Instead, they help consultants analyze client inquiries, prepare for meetings, and develop better responses and proposals for their clients.**
