# AWS Serverless Deployment Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines requirements for a truly serverless deployment of the Cloud Consulting Platform using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and other pay-per-use services. This approach minimizes costs for low-traffic applications by only charging when the application is actually used.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Pay-Per-Use Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a startup founder, I want infrastructure that only charges when users actually use my application so that I have near-zero costs during periods of no usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application has no traffic THEN the infrastructure cost SHALL be near zero (under $1/month)
2. WHEN users access the application THEN the system SHALL only charge for actual usage (requests, compute time, storage)
3. WHEN traffic is sporadic THEN the system SHALL automatically scale to zero during idle periods
4. WHEN usage increases THEN the system SHALL automatically scale up without manual intervention
5. WHEN monitoring costs THEN the system SHALL provide clear per-request cost visibility

### Requirement 2: Lambda-Based Backend

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my Go backend to run on AWS Lambda so that I only pay for actual request processing time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the backend THEN the system SHALL convert the Go application to Lambda functions
2. WHEN handling requests THEN the system SHALL use API Gateway for HTTP routing to Lambda
3. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL maintain existing functionality (AI, email, chat)
4. WHEN scaling THEN the system SHALL automatically handle concurrent requests up to Lambda limits
5. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the system SHALL minimize cold start times

### Requirement 3: Serverless Database Options

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want a database that scales to zero when not in use so that I don't pay for idle database time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN choosing database THEN the system SHALL evaluate DynamoDB vs Aurora Serverless v2 vs RDS Proxy
2. WHEN the application is idle THEN the database costs SHALL be minimal or zero
3. WHEN migrating data THEN the system SHALL provide migration path from PostgreSQL schema
4. WHEN querying data THEN the system SHALL maintain application performance requirements
5. WHEN scaling THEN the database SHALL automatically handle traffic spikes

### Requirement 4: Static Frontend Hosting

**User Story:** As a developer, I want my React frontend hosted cost-effectively so that static hosting costs are minimal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hosting frontend THEN the system SHALL use S3 + CloudFront for static hosting
2. WHEN serving content THEN the system SHALL provide global CDN distribution
3. WHEN updating content THEN the system SHALL support automated deployments
4. WHEN configuring SSL THEN the system SHALL use free SSL certificates via CloudFront
5. WHEN optimizing costs THEN the system SHALL leverage free tier allowances

### Requirement 5: Serverless Caching

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want caching that doesn't charge when not in use so that I can optimize performance without fixed costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing caching THEN the system SHALL use DynamoDB for session storage
2. WHEN caching AI responses THEN the system SHALL use S3 for large object caching
3. WHEN the application is idle THEN caching costs SHALL be near zero
4. WHEN cache expires THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up old data
5. WHEN scaling THEN caching SHALL handle concurrent access patterns

### Requirement 6: Event-Driven Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want asynchronous processing for emails and reports so that user requests remain fast while background tasks run efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending emails THEN the system SHALL use SQS queues for asynchronous processing
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL use Lambda for background processing
3. WHEN processing events THEN the system SHALL handle failures with retry logic
4. WHEN monitoring processing THEN the system SHALL provide visibility into queue status
5. WHEN scaling THEN the system SHALL automatically process events based on queue depth

### Requirement 7: Cost Optimization

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want detailed cost tracking so that I can understand and optimize my infrastructure spending.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tracking costs THEN the system SHALL provide per-service cost breakdown
2. WHEN optimizing THEN the system SHALL identify cost optimization opportunities
3. WHEN setting limits THEN the system SHALL implement cost controls and alerts
4. WHEN forecasting THEN the system SHALL predict costs based on usage patterns
5. WHEN comparing options THEN the system SHALL provide cost comparison with other architectures

### Requirement 8: Development and Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want local development that mimics serverless architecture so that I can test changes before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing locally THEN the system SHALL support local Lambda simulation
2. WHEN testing THEN the system SHALL provide integration testing for serverless components
3. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL provide access to Lambda logs and metrics
4. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL support staging environments with minimal costs
5. WHEN validating THEN the system SHALL ensure compatibility between local and deployed versions

### Requirement 9: Migration Strategy

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want a clear migration path from the current architecture so that I can transition safely to serverless.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step migration procedures
2. WHEN preserving data THEN the system SHALL migrate existing PostgreSQL data safely
3. WHEN maintaining uptime THEN the system SHALL support blue-green deployment
4. WHEN rolling back THEN the system SHALL provide rollback procedures if needed
5. WHEN validating THEN the system SHALL ensure all functionality works post-migration

### Requirement 10: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want comprehensive monitoring for serverless components so that I can troubleshoot issues and optimize performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring THEN the system SHALL use CloudWatch for Lambda metrics and logs
2. WHEN tracing requests THEN the system SHALL implement distributed tracing with X-Ray
3. WHEN alerting THEN the system SHALL set up alerts for errors and performance issues
4. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL track cold starts and execution times
5. WHEN optimizing THEN the system SHALL provide insights for performance improvements
