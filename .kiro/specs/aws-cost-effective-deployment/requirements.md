# Cost-Effective AWS Deployment Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for setting up a cost-effective AWS deployment for the Cloud Consulting Platform during the early startup phase. The focus is on minimizing costs while maintaining functionality, with the ability to scale up as the business grows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Minimal Cost Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a startup founder, I want to deploy my application with minimal AWS costs so that I can validate my business model without high infrastructure expenses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the infrastructure THEN the total monthly cost SHALL be under $20/month
2. WHEN using AWS free tier THEN the system SHALL leverage free tier eligible services where possible
3. WHEN the application has no users THEN the infrastructure costs SHALL be minimal or zero
4. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL provide a clear upgrade path to more robust infrastructure
5. WHEN monitoring costs THEN the system SHALL include billing alerts to prevent unexpected charges

### Requirement 2: Single Instance Deployment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy my entire application stack on a single EC2 instance so that I can minimize complexity and costs while maintaining functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL run both frontend and backend on a single EC2 instance
2. WHEN setting up the database THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL installed directly on the instance
3. WHEN configuring caching THEN the system SHALL use Redis installed on the same instance
4. WHEN setting up SSL THEN the system SHALL use Let's Encrypt for free SSL certificates
5. WHEN configuring the web server THEN the system SHALL use Nginx for reverse proxy and static file serving

### Requirement 3: Database and Storage

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want a reliable database solution that doesn't charge when not in use so that I can store application data cost-effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the database THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL installed on the EC2 instance
2. WHEN configuring backups THEN the system SHALL implement automated backups to S3
3. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use the instance's EBS volume for database storage
4. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL provide migration path to RDS
5. WHEN ensuring reliability THEN the system SHALL implement database backup and restore procedures

### Requirement 4: Domain and SSL Configuration

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want proper domain configuration with SSL certificates so that users can access the application securely without additional costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring DNS THEN the system SHALL use Route 53 for domain management
2. WHEN setting up SSL THEN the system SHALL use Let's Encrypt for free SSL certificates
3. WHEN configuring domains THEN the system SHALL support both www and non-www versions
4. WHEN renewing certificates THEN the system SHALL automatically renew Let's Encrypt certificates
5. WHEN redirecting traffic THEN the system SHALL redirect HTTP to HTTPS

### Requirement 5: Monitoring and Alerting

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want basic monitoring and cost alerts so that I can track system health and prevent unexpected AWS charges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up monitoring THEN the system SHALL use CloudWatch basic monitoring (free tier)
2. WHEN configuring alerts THEN the system SHALL set up billing alerts for cost control
3. WHEN monitoring application THEN the system SHALL track basic metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
4. WHEN logging errors THEN the system SHALL implement basic application logging
5. WHEN scaling up THEN the system SHALL provide upgrade path to advanced monitoring

### Requirement 6: Backup and Recovery

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want automated backups so that I can recover from failures without losing data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backing up data THEN the system SHALL create daily database backups to S3
2. WHEN backing up application THEN the system SHALL backup application configuration and code
3. WHEN storing backups THEN the system SHALL use S3 Standard-IA for cost-effective storage
4. WHEN retaining backups THEN the system SHALL keep backups for 30 days
5. WHEN recovering THEN the system SHALL provide documented recovery procedures

### Requirement 7: Security Configuration

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want proper security controls so that the application is protected from unauthorized access while maintaining cost efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring access THEN the system SHALL use security groups to restrict access
2. WHEN managing secrets THEN the system SHALL store sensitive configuration securely
3. WHEN updating the system THEN the system SHALL implement automated security updates
4. WHEN accessing the instance THEN the system SHALL use SSH key-based authentication
5. WHEN configuring firewall THEN the system SHALL only open required ports (80, 443, 22)

### Requirement 8: Deployment and Updates

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simple deployment and update procedures so that I can deploy changes quickly without complex orchestration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying code THEN the system SHALL support simple deployment scripts
2. WHEN updating the application THEN the system SHALL minimize downtime during updates
3. WHEN rolling back THEN the system SHALL support quick rollback procedures
4. WHEN automating deployment THEN the system SHALL integrate with GitHub Actions
5. WHEN managing environments THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific configurations

### Requirement 9: Scalability Path

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want a clear upgrade path so that I can scale the infrastructure as my business grows and generates revenue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN business grows THEN the system SHALL provide migration path to RDS
2. WHEN traffic increases THEN the system SHALL support migration to load-balanced setup
3. WHEN scaling up THEN the system SHALL provide migration to EKS or ECS
4. WHEN adding features THEN the system SHALL support additional AWS services integration
5. WHEN optimizing costs THEN the system SHALL provide cost analysis and optimization recommendations

### Requirement 10: Development and Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test changes safely so that I can validate updates before deploying to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing changes THEN the system SHALL support staging environment setup
2. WHEN developing locally THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with local development
3. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL support automated testing in CI/CD
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL provide access to logs and metrics
5. WHEN validating deployment THEN the system SHALL include health check endpoints
