# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current WebSocket-based chat system is experiencing persistent connectivity issues with error code 1005 (connection closed without status). This feature implements a reliable polling-based chat system as an alternative that uses standard HTTP requests instead of maintaining persistent WebSocket connections.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want a reliable chat system that works consistently without connection drops so that I can communicate with the AI consultant without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the chat interface THEN the system SHALL establish communication within 2 seconds using HTTP polling
2. WHEN the user sends a message THEN the system SHALL deliver it via HTTP POST request and confirm delivery
3. IF the network is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue messages and retry automatically
4. WHEN new messages are available THEN the system SHALL retrieve them within 5 seconds via polling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple and maintainable chat implementation so that I can avoid complex WebSocket lifecycle management issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the chat system THEN it SHALL use only standard HTTP GET/POST requests
2. WHEN polling for messages THEN the system SHALL use efficient polling intervals (3-5 seconds)
3. IF no new messages are available THEN the polling SHALL not overload the server with unnecessary requests
4. WHEN the user is inactive THEN the system SHALL reduce polling frequency to conserve resources

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the chat system to be resilient to network issues so that users have a consistent experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL continue attempting to reconnect with exponential backoff
2. WHEN the server is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL show appropriate status messages
3. IF messages fail to send THEN the system SHALL retry automatically and show delivery status
4. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL sync any missed messages automatically

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time-like chat experience even with polling so that conversations feel natural and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message THEN it SHALL appear immediately with "sending" status
2. WHEN the message is confirmed delivered THEN the status SHALL update to "delivered"
3. IF a message fails to send THEN the user SHALL see a "failed" status with retry option
4. WHEN new messages arrive THEN they SHALL appear within 5 seconds of being sent

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the polling-based chat to integrate seamlessly with the existing admin interface so that I don't notice the difference from WebSocket implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the chat interface THEN it SHALL look and behave identically to the WebSocket version
2. WHEN switching between admin pages THEN the chat state SHALL be preserved
3. IF the user refreshes the page THEN recent chat history SHALL be restored
4. WHEN multiple admin users are chatting THEN each SHALL see updates from others via polling
