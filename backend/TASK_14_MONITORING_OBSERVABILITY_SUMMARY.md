- **Response Data**: Basic status and service identification

#### `/health/email-system/readiness` - Kubernetes Readiness Probe
- **Purpose**: Readiness check for load balancer integration
- **Response Codes**: 200 (ready), 503 (not ready)
- **Response Data**: Readiness status with component details

#### `/health/email-system/deep` - Deep Health Check
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive diagnostic information
- **Response Codes**: 200 (healthy), 206 (degraded), 503 (unhealthy)
- **Response Data**: Detailed metrics, alert configuration, recent alerts, recommendations

### 4. Alerting for High Email Event Recording Failure Rates ✅

**Location**: `backend/internal/services/email_system_alerting_service.go`

**Alerting Features**:

#### Configurable Thresholds
- `RecordingFailureRateThreshold`: 5% (warning level)
- `HighFailureRateThreshold`: 20% (high alert level)
- `CriticalFailureRateThreshold`: 50% (critical alert level)
- `ConsecutiveFailureThreshold`: 3 consecutive failures

#### Alert Levels
- **Warning**: Low-level issues requiring attention
- **High**: Significant issues requiring immediate action
- **Critical**: System-threatening issues requiring urgent response

#### Alert Suppression
- Configurable suppression window (default: 1 hour)
- Prevents alert flooding during extended outages
- Automatic suppression activation for critical alerts

#### Background Monitoring
- Continuous health monitoring with configurable intervals
- Automatic alert level determination based on metrics
- Alert state tracking and lifecycle management

### 5. Additional Monitoring Infrastructure ✅

#### Email Monitoring Service
**Location**: `backend/internal/services/email_monitoring_service.go`

- Aggregates metrics from all email system components
- Provides unified health status reporting
- Manages alert configuration and recent alert history
- Calculates derived metrics (throughput, processing time)

#### Prometheus Metrics Export
**Location**: `backend/internal/handlers/email_monitoring_handler.go`

- `/metrics/prometheus/email-system` endpoint
- Standard Prometheus format with HELP and TYPE comments
- Comprehensive metrics for external monitoring systems
- Counter and gauge metrics for all key performance indicators

#### Alert Configuration Management
- Runtime configuration updates via REST API
- Persistent alert configuration storage
- Validation of alert threshold ranges
- Support for multiple alert destinations (email, Slack, PagerDuty)

## Testing and Validation
