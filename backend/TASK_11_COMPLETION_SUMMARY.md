**Key Types**:
- `StatusReportRequest` - Input parameters for report generation
- `StatusReport` - Complete status report with all sections
- `ProjectMilestone` - Project milestone tracking
- `BudgetStatus` - Budget tracking information
- `TimelineStatus` - Timeline and progress tracking

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Service Layer**: `ClientCommunicationService` implements the core business logic
- **Interface Layer**: Defines contracts and data structures
- **AI Integration**: Uses AWS Bedrock for content generation
- **Prompt Engineering**: Sophisticated prompts for different communication types

### Key Methods
1. `GenerateTechnicalExplanation()` - Creates business-friendly technical explanations
2. `GeneratePresentationSlides()` - Builds professional presentation materials
3. `GenerateEmailTemplate()` - Generates client communication templates
4. `GenerateStatusReport()` - Creates project progress reports

### Prompt Engineering
- Context-aware prompts that adapt to audience type and complexity level
- Industry-specific considerations and compliance requirements
- Structured output formatting for consistent results
- Business value focus with technical accuracy

### Content Parsing
- Intelligent parsing of AI-generated content into structured formats
- Section-based parsing for different content types
- Glossary and reference extraction
- Bullet point and list processing

## Testing
**Test File**: `backend/test_task11_only.go`

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Technical explanation generation for AWS Lambda serverless architecture
- ✅ Presentation slide creation for AWS migration strategy
- ✅ Email template generation for client follow-ups
- ✅ Status report creation for ongoing projects

**Test Results**: All tests passed successfully, demonstrating:
- Proper content generation for different audience types
- Structured output with all required fields
- Integration with mock Bedrock service
- Correct parsing and formatting of generated content

## Integration Points
- **AWS Bedrock Service**: For AI-powered content generation
- **Prompt Architect**: For sophisticated prompt engineering
- **Domain Models**: Integration with existing inquiry and project structures

## Business Value
1. **Stakeholder Communication**: Enables effective communication with different stakeholder types
2. **Professional Materials**: Generates high-quality presentations and reports
3. **Time Savings**: Automates creation of communication materials
4. **Consistency**: Ensures consistent messaging and professional quality
5. **Scalability**: Supports multiple projects and communication needs simultaneously

## Usage Examples
```go
// Technical explanation for executives
req := &interfaces.TechnicalExplanationRequest{
    TechnicalConcept: "AWS Lambda Serverless Architecture",
    AudienceType:     interfaces.CommunicationAudienceExecutive,
    ComplexityLevel:  interfaces.ComplexityIntermediate,
    IndustryContext:  "Financial Services",
}

// Professional email template
emailReq := &interfaces.EmailTemplateRequest{
    Purpose:       interfaces.EmailFollowUp,
    RecipientType: interfaces.RecipientClient,
    ToneStyle:     interfaces.ToneProfessional,
    Context:       "AWS migration discussion follow-up",
}
```

## Future Enhancements
1. **Template Customization**: Allow custom branding and styling
2. **Multi-language Support**: Generate content in different languages
3. **Integration with CRM**: Connect with customer relationship management systems
4. **Analytics**: Track communication effectiveness and engagement
5. **Collaboration Features**: Enable team review and approval workflows

## Conclusion
Task 11 has been successfully completed with a comprehensive set of client communication tools that enable consultants to effectively communicate complex AWS concepts to different stakeholder types. The implementation provides professional-quality materials while maintaining technical accuracy and business relevance.
