# Markdown to HTML Conversion Test

This test demonstrates the improved email formatting with Markdown to HTML conversion for AI-generated reports.

## What Changed

### Before:
- AI reports were displayed as raw text in `<pre>` tags
- Markdown formatting was not rendered (headers, bold, lists, etc.)
- Reports looked like plain code blocks

### After:
- AI reports are converted from Markdown to properly formatted HTML
- Headers, bold text, lists, and other formatting are rendered beautifully
- Plain text fallback is provided for email clients that don't support HTML
- All user input is properly escaped to prevent XSS attacks

## Test the Conversion

- Bold text highlighting

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8061/api/v1/inquiries \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{

    "services": ["assessment"],
    "message": "I need a comprehensive assessment of our current infrastructure with detailed recommendations for cloud migration."
